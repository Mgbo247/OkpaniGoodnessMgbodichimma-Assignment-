No_1. Intelligent Agent.
Intelligent agents are software applications that can perform tasks on behalf of users or other software systems, often using machine learning algorithms and other AI techniques. These agents can collect and analyze data, perform automated tasks, and make recommendations based on user preferences and historical actions. Some examples of real-life applications of intelligent agents include:

1. Personal assistants: These intelligent agents, such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, help users with tasks like scheduling meetings, managing to-do lists, and answering questions.

2. Customer service: Many companies use AI-powered chatbots as a way to provide round-the-clock customer support, answering frequently asked questions and resolving simple issues without human intervention.

3. Financial services: Intelligent agents are increasingly being used in the finance industry for tasks like fraud detection, trading analysis, and risk management.

4. Supply chain management: Many companies use intelligent agents to track inventory levels, monitor shipments, and optimize logistics procedures.

5. Healthcare: Intelligent agents are being studied for their potential to support personalized medicine, analyze patient data, and assist with clinical decision-making.

6. Cybersecurity: Intelligent agents are used to monitor networks and detect potential security threats, as well as to automate incident response and remediation.

7. Education: Intelligent tutoring systems use AI techniques to provide personalized learning experiences for students, providing adaptive feedback and recommendations based on their individual strengths and weaknesses.

Some companies that use intelligent agents include Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. For example, Amazon's recommendation system uses intelligent agents to analyze user behaviors and suggest products based on their preferences. Google uses intelligent agents to power its search engine and provide personalized recommendations for content. IBM's Watson AI platform includes a range of intelligent agent capabilities, such as natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive analytics.
