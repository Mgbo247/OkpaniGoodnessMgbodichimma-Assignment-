The 3 AI i chose are intelligent agent, speech recognition and Locomotion.

No_1. Intelligent Agent.
Intelligent agents are software applications that can perform tasks on behalf of users or other software systems, often using machine learning algorithms and other AI techniques. These agents can collect and analyze data, perform automated tasks, and make recommendations based on user preferences and historical actions. Some examples of real-life applications of intelligent agents include:

1. Personal assistants: These intelligent agents, such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, help users with tasks like scheduling meetings, managing to-do lists, and answering questions.

2. Customer service: Many companies use AI-powered chatbots as a way to provide round-the-clock customer support, answering frequently asked questions and resolving simple issues without human intervention.

3. Financial services: Intelligent agents are increasingly being used in the finance industry for tasks like fraud detection, trading analysis, and risk management.

4. Supply chain management: Many companies use intelligent agents to track inventory levels, monitor shipments, and optimize logistics procedures.

5. Healthcare: Intelligent agents are being studied for their potential to support personalized medicine, analyze patient data, and assist with clinical decision-making.

6. Cybersecurity: Intelligent agents are used to monitor networks and detect potential security threats, as well as to automate incident response and remediation.

7. Education: Intelligent tutoring systems use AI techniques to provide personalized learning experiences for students, providing adaptive feedback and recommendations based on their individual strengths and weaknesses.

Some companies that use intelligent agents include Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. For example, Amazon's recommendation system uses intelligent agents to analyze user behaviors and suggest products based on their preferences. Google uses intelligent agents to power its search engine and provide personalized recommendations for content. IBM's Watson AI platform includes a range of intelligent agent capabilities, such as natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive analytics.


No_2 Speech Recognition.

Speech recognition technology is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to understand spoken language and convert it into written text or other useful actions. It uses techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) to identify and interpret human speech.

There are many real-life applications of speech recognition technology, including:

1. Voice assistants: Voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use speech recognition technology to understand voice commands and perform tasks like playing songs, making phone calls, or setting reminders.

2. Transcription services: Transcription services like Dragon Naturally Speaking allow users to transcribe audio recordings into written text, making it easy to create meeting notes, blog posts, or other written content.

3. Customer service: Many customer service centers use speech recognition to route calls and gather information about customer needs, reducing the time and effort required to help customers.

4. Healthcare: Medical professionals use speech recognition technology to dictate patient notes and reports, improving the speed and accuracy of medical documentation.

5. Automotive: Car makers are using speech recognition technology to create more sophisticated voice-activated infotainment systems, enabling drivers to perform tasks like checking the weather or adjusting the radio without taking their hands off the wheel.

6. Call center analytics: Speech recognition technology is used in call centers to analyze customer conversations and extract insights about customer needs, preferences and behavior.

7. Security: Speech recognition technology is being utilized in security systems to enable voice authentication, recognizing people only by their voiceprint and giving access only to authorized individuals.

Companies that use speech recognition technology include Amazon (Alexa), Apple (Siri), Google (Google Assistant), IBM (Watson), Microsoft (Cortana), Samsung (Bixby), Nuance Communications (Dragon Naturally Speaking), and Speechmatics.


No.3. Locomotion.

Locomotion in artificial intelligence refers to the movement of robots or other autonomous systems. For the past few decades, there has been a lot of research in the field of locomotion, with the aim of creating robots and machines that can move in ways that are similar to humans and animals. This has led to the development of a range of locomotion techniques, from bipedal walking and running to swimming and flying.

Here are some real-life applications of AI-based locomotion:

1. Robotics: Robots are being designed to move in different ways, such as walking, climbing or rolling, allowing machines to perform a wider range of tasks.

2. Military: Robots have been developed for ground-based transportation and scouting in military missions, and drones for airborne reconnaissance.

3. Healthcare: Robotic systems are used to provide mobility assistance to patients with mobility disabilities, helping them to perform everyday activities.

4. Agriculture: Autonomous farming robots that can plant and harvest crops, maintain soil quality and perform other tasks are being developed to help increase production and reduce labour costs.

5. Automotive: Autonomous vehicles that can move around without human intervention are already being tested by major automotive brands such as Tesla, Google, and Uber.

6. Space exploration: Robots are being used to explore other planets and satellites, such as the Mars Rover.

7. Entertainment: Robots can now move around and entertain guests in theme parks, or used in movie special effects.

One example of a company that uses AI-based locomotion is Boston Dynamics, which designs and creates robots with advanced mobility. Another example is the French company, Exotec Solutions, that uses robots to pick and deliver orders in warehouses. Altitude Angel is also a company that makes use of drones to offer a real-time look at air traffic, to assist in their mission to create more efficient and safer skies.
